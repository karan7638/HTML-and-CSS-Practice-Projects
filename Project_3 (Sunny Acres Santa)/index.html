                    This year Sunny Acres becomes Wintery Acres as we institute our first Holidays on the Farm. 
                    Join us on weekends from November 23 through January 5 for holiday cheer and festivities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sunny Acres Farm Shop will be decked out in bright and colorful holiday decorations with special prices 
                    on garlands, tinsel, ornaments, and wreaths. Be sure to sample our homemade egg nog and bring some home 
                    for your family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trails and hills around Sunny Acres will be alive with fun and games. Come join us for sleigh rides or 
                    zoom down our awesome sledding hill (weather permitting). Sunny Acres is adjacent to Dawson Park, which 
                    has a vast network of cross-country ski trails for every level of skier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've even decorated our barn for the holidays. Come visit Santa's stables, where you might even see a few 
                    reindeer—perhaps even one with a red nose!
