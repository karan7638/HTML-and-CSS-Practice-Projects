                        The almighty has his own purposes."woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be
                        that
                        offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If we shall suppose that
                        American
                        slavery is
                        one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having
                        continued
                        through
                        his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both North and South this
                        terrible
                        war, as
                        the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those
                        divine
                        attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him?

                    <p>

                        Fondly do we hope fervently do we pray - that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.
                        Yet, if God
                        wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years
                        of
                        unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by
                        another
                        drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "The
                        judgments
                        of the
                        Lord are true and righteous altogether."

                        With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to
                        see
                        the right,
                        let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him
                        who
                        shall
                        have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish
                        a
                        just and
                        lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.
